** Coproc - Using SSH instead
*** DONE CPU - per core?
    CLOSED: [2013-11-06 Wed 15:49]
    This is implemented as a total load reading.
**** DONE Possibly need a 2s sleep before taking measurements
     CLOSED: [2013-11-08 Wed 15:49]
     This didn't help the top cpu readings but taking for readings then using 'tail -n +2'
     to skip the first one and average the last three appears to give more consistante readings.
*** DONE Mem
    CLOSED: [2013-11-06 Wed 15:49]
    This is polled from the 'free -m' output, excluding the disk cache from the computed used memory value.
*** DONE Disk
    CLOSED: [2013-11-05 Wed 15:48]
    Just parsed 'df -h | tail -n +2' output through awk.
***  -- Top - not included in report
    Not really useful, not used.
*** DONE Service - specified in config script
    CLOSED: [2013-11-06 Wed 15:48]
    Services just check the running processes list because I couldn't find a reliable way to parse 'service serviceName status' output over SSH.

* Features 
** Run as service - abandoned in favor of running as a crontask   
** rsyslog for DB log storage (stretch goal)
** DONE email notifications
   CLOSED: [2013-11-06 Wed 15:47]
   Email notifications appear to work but must be used with the heirloom mailx implementation.
   The BSD and GNU implementations didn't appear to work with Exchange or the ETS smtp server for
   whatever reason but the heirloom mailx binary works just fine. The advantage is that the smtp
   server can be explicitly specified rather than infered from mx records.
** DONE Only send notifications on repeat problem
   CLOSED: [2013-11-13 Wed 16:52]
   The idea is that instead of sending an email notification, it should write a trigger file
   so the next time the sript runs, if there is need to send a notification and that file
   exists, the notifications will be sent. This will cut down on getting an email every time
   the application is starting up or reindexing the content database.

   Notifications are now only sent the second time that any given thresholds are broken.
